# Practice
A place for practicing small code exercises in different languages.

I am trying to solve [fizzbuzz](http://codingdojo.org/cgi-bin/index.pl?KataFizzBuzz) and [roman numerals](http://codingdojo.org/cgi-bin/index.pl?KataRomanNumerals) katas through TDD in different languages so I can learn the very basics.
